                &emsp; &emsp; Hello my name is Bryce Albertazzi. I am graduating from Oregon State in 2021 with a computer science degree. I am passionate about developing software that solves
                problems and makes people's lives easier. I have a wide variey of skills in mobile/web/cloud development and deployment. I discovered computer science was a great fit
                for me when I began making games with Unity and publishing some of my games onto the iOS App Store and other platforms. Later, I got into web and mobile developmet.
                I learned the ropes of several different web/moblile dev platforms including Angular, React, React Native, Ionic, Vue, Flutter, XCode and Andriod Studio. I then sought out
                to expand my skill further by exploring cloud development. While doing this I earned AWS Cloud Practionier and AWS Developer certifications. I also familiarized myself 
                with deploying to platforms such as Google Firebase, Netlify, AWS, and more. I believe I can be an asset to many companies with my broad experience in many
                areas of computer science.
