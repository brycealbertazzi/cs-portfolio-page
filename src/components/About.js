                &emsp; &emsp; Hello my name is Bryce Albertazzi. I am graduating from Oregon State in 2021 with a computer science degree. I am passionate about developing software that solves
                problems and makes people's lives easier. I have a wide variey of skills in mobile/web/cloud development and deployment. I discovered computer science was a great fit
                for me when I began making games with Unity and publishing some of my games onto the iOS App Store and other platforms. Later, I got into web and mobile development.
                I learned the ropes of several different web/mobile dev frameworks including Angular, React, React Native, Ionic, Vue, Flutter, XCode and Android Studio. I then worked
                to expand my skills further by exploring cloud development. While doing this, I earned AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Developer certifications. I also familiarized myself 
                with deploying to platforms such as Google Firebase, Netlify, AWS, and more. I believe I can be an asset to many companies with my broad experience in many
                areas of computer science.

                &emsp; &emsp; In my spare time I enjoy taking walks and watching sports. I am a big 49ers fan, I watch their games every Sunday during the football
                season. I watch other sports as well including baseball, basketball and tennis. I played baseball through high school and have enjoyed playing on intramural softball and
                basketball teams in college. I enjoy being social and doing fun activities with other people like playing board/card games and going outside.
